/* Create an HTML document resembling a simple newspaper article, with a headline, a list of authors, a short topical summary on top and then some regular text. 

Now, together with your partner plan on applying CSS rules through inline-styles, the <style> tag and an external CSS document simultaneously.

Define the effects that you want to achieve and spread them out over these three sources. Now prepare some fallback styles, for example a different font-family or color, in another source or with less specificity, in a way that you think they will not be affecting your document.

Is your page behaving the way it should be? How about when you remove some of the active CSS rules? Are your fallbacks being used as expected? */
